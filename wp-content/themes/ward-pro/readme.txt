== ABOUT WARD PRO ==

Create a truly unique design with Ward Pro, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme. Use the theme customizer to add your own page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress, BuddyPress, Woocommerce & WPML. Choose from 20 of the most popular Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Designed for desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/ward-pro/.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* The four boxes on the home page are Image Text Widget added to the Home Page Top Area. You need to add your own widgets to make the default ones disappear.
* The home page is designed without any sidebars therefore the only widgetized areas that appear are the Home Page Top Area and the Extended Footer. Archive and search results pages have no sidebars and only the Extended Footer widgetized area.
